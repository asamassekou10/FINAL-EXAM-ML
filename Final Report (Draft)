🚀 TEAM REPORT – Final Machine Learning Project

Student Academic Performance Prediction System
Team: Peter Amoye – Erick Banegas – Alhassane Samassekou
Course: ITAI 1371
Date: December 2025

1. Introduction

This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning system capable of predicting whether a student will Pass or Fail based on a combination of academic, behavioral, and socio-educational factors. By analyzing patterns in student performance, attendance, study habits, and family background, the model aims to support early prediction and intervention strategies within academic environments.

The goal of the team was to design a complete end-to-end ML pipeline, including:

Dataset analysis and preparation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and preprocessing

Testing multiple ML algorithms

Model comparison and selection

Evaluation and interpretation

Team collaboration and technical documentation

This report summarizes the methodology, results, and collaborative effort of the entire group.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information from 1,000 students, described through 14 features:

Academic Performance

math_score

reading_score

writing_score

Behavioral Factors

attendance_rate

study_hours

Socio-Educational Context

parent_education

internet_access

lunch_type

extra_activities

Target Variable

final_result (Pass / Fail)

The dataset was clean, balanced, and contained no missing values, which allowed the models to learn patterns with high accuracy.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The team performed an extensive EDA to understand the dataset deeply. Key findings include:

3.1 Academic performance strongly predicts final outcome

Math, reading, and writing scores showed the highest correlation with the final result.

3.2 Attendance rate matters

Students with higher attendance (above 95%) predominantly passed.

3.3 Study hours show a positive trend

Higher study hours correlate with improved performance.

3.4 Parent education influence

Students with parents holding Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degrees showed higher pass rates.

3.5 Visualizations generated

Histograms for all numeric variables

Boxplots for score distributions

Heatmap of correlations

Performance comparisons by gender

Scatterplots between study hours and academic scores

Distribution of pass/fail categories

These visual insights guided the feature preprocessing decisions.

4. Preprocessing Pipeline

To prepare the dataset for machine learning, the team implemented a full preprocessing pipeline using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline from scikit-learn.

Steps included:
✔ Encoding categorical features

One-Hot Encoding for:

gender

parent_education

lunch_type

internet_access

extra_activities

✔ Scaling numerical features

Standardization applied to:

math_score

reading_score

writing_score

attendance_rate

study_hours

✔ Train–Test Split

Dataset was split into 80% training and 20% test.

This pipeline ensured a clean, consistent, and reproducible modeling process.

5. Machine Learning Models

The team trained and evaluated the following eight classifiers:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

Naive Bayes

All models were embedded inside pipelines to guarantee correct preprocessing during both training and prediction.

6. Model Evaluation and Comparison

Each model was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Key Results (from Model_comparison_Group3.csv):
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	1.00	1.00	1.00	1.00	1.00
Gradient Boosting	0.99	1.00	1.00	1.00	1.00
XGBoost	0.99	0.99	1.00	0.995	1.00
Random Forest	0.99	0.99	0.91	0.947	0.991
SVM	0.99	1.00	1.00	1.00	1.00
KNN	0.98	0.95	0.89	0.908	0.96
Decision Tree	0.85	0.91	0.76	0.86	0.98
Naive Bayes	0.99	0.98	1.00	0.968	0.991
⭐ Best Overall Models

Logistic Regression

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

These models achieved near-perfect scores.
The team concluded that the dataset is highly separable, particularly due to the strong predictive power of academic scores.

7. Discussion of High Performance

The nearly perfect model performance may raise questions.
The team analyzed this carefully, concluding:

Academic scores provide extremely strong signals.

There is minimal noise in the dataset.

The pass/fail boundary is almost linearly separable.

There are no missing values or inconsistent entries.

The features correlate strongly with the outcome.

Therefore, achieving F1-scores near 1.00 is reasonable.

8. Final Model Selection

Although Gradient Boosting and XGBoost performed exceptionally well, the team selected Logistic Regression as the final model because:

It achieved perfect performance

It is simpler and more interpretable

It is easier to deploy in real systems

It avoids overfitting concerns

It gives clear weight coefficients for each feature

10. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the complete lifecycle of building a machine learning system—from data exploration and preprocessing to model experimentation, evaluation, and final deployment decisions.

The Student Academic Performance Predictor proved highly effective, producing near-perfect classification metrics. The results confirm that academic performance indicators, attendance, and study habits are strong predictors of student success.

This project reflects strong teamwork, solid understanding of machine learning techniques, and the ability to apply theoretical concepts to a real-world educational dataset.
